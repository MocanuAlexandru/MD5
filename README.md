# MD5
In this project I made an implementation for the hash function MD5. The paper explains how the MD5 function works and how someone can generate a collision for such a function.

A presentation for this project can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nbHSftLalNuDKXY-WpZgY9wGai5uVcHxKKzr1ifTZi0/edit?usp=sharing
